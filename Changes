1.14     2015-06-11 (PERLANCAR)

         - First release, split from Perinci-CmdLine-Lite dist to be more
           independent. Become a test suite for all Perinci::CmdLine backends
           (Inline, Classic, Lite). Currently the tests are absolutely minimal
           (old tests have not been re-added to the suite).
